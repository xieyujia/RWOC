## Environment setup <a name="environment-setup">
This code has been tested on Ubuntu 16.04, Python 3.6, Pytorch> 0.4.1, CUDA 9.0 and CUDA 10.0, GTX 1080Ti, Titan X and RTX Titan GPUs.

**warning: the results can be slightly different due to Pytorch version and CUDA version.**

- Clone the repository 
```
git clone https://github.com/yihongXU/deepMOT.git && cd deepmot
```
**Option 1:**
- Setup python environment
```
conda create -n deepmot python=3.6
source activate deepmot
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**Option 2:**
we offer Singularity images (similar to Docker) for training and testing.
- Open a terminal
- Install singularity
```
sudo apt-get install -y singularity-container
```
- Download a Singularity image and put it to *deepmot/SingularityImages* <br />

[pytorch1-1-cuda100-cudnn75.simg(tencent cloud)](https://share.weiyun.com/5sTjg6J)
- Open a new terminal
- Launch a Singularity image
```shell
cd deepmot
singularity shell --nv --bind yourLocalPath:yourPathInsideImage ./SingularityImages/pytorch1-1-cuda100-cudnn75.simg
```
**- -bind: to link a singularity path with a local path. By doing this, you can find data from local PC inside Singularity image;** <br />
**- -nv: use local Nvidia driver.**

## Testing <a name="testing-models">
We provide code for performing tracking with our pre-trained models on MOT Challenge dataset. The code outputs txt files for MOT Challenge submissions, they can also be used for plotting bounding boxes and visualization. 
- [Setup](#environment-setup) your environment

- Download MOT data
Dataset can be downloaded here: e.g. [MOT17](https://motchallenge.net/data/MOT17/) 

- Put *MOT* dataset into *deepmot/data/* and it should have the following structure:
```
            mot
            |-------train
            |    |
            |    |---video_folder1
            |    |   |---det
            |    |   |---gt
            |    |   |---img1
            |    |
            |    |---video_folder2
            ...
            |-------test
            |    |
            |    |---video_folder1
            |    |   |---det
            |    |   |---img1
            ...
```
- Download pretrained models
all the pretrained models can be downloaded here: <br />
[pretrained models(google drive)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HPreiyWbOhgAxhCtvYvoB8wzt_reKzdW?usp=sharing) or <br />
[pretrained models(tencent cloud)](https://share.weiyun.com/5rVqDmu)

-Put all pre-trained models to *deepmot/pretrained/*
- run tracking code
```
python tracking_on_mot.py
```
for more details about parameters, do:
```
python tracking_on_mot.py -h
```
The results are save by default under *deepmot/saved_results/txts/test_folder/*.

- Visualization
After finishing tracking, you can visualize your results by plotting bounding box to images.
```
python plot_results.py
```
the results are save by default under *deepmot/saved_results/imgs/test_folder*

**Note:** 
- we clean the detections with nms and threshold of detection scores. They are saved into numpy array in the folder *deepmot/clean_detections*, if you have trouble opening them, try to add *allow_pickle=True* to *np.load()* function.

### Results
We provide codes for evaluting tracking results in terms of MOTP and MOTA:
```
python evaluation.py --txts_path=yourTxTfilesFolder
```
MOT17:

|  dataset  | MOTA     | MOTP     | FN     | FP    | IDsW | Total Nb. Objs |
|-----------|----------|----------|--------|-------|------|----------------|
|   train   |  49.249% |  82.812% | 149575 | 19807 | 1592 |     336891     |
|   test    |  48.500% |  76.900% | 262765 | 24544 | 3160 |     564228     |

**Note:** 
- the results are better than reported in the paper because we add Camera Motion Compensation to deal with moving camera videos.
- the results can be slightly different depending on the running environment.

The trained models are save by default under *deepmot/saved_models/* folder. <br />
The tensorboard logs are saved by default under *deepmot/logs/train_log/* folder and you can visualize your training process by:
```
tensorboard --logdir=/mnt/beegfs/perception/yixu/opensource/deepMOT/logs/train_log
```
**Note:** 
- you should install *tensorflow* (see [tensorflow installation](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip)) in order to visualize your training process.
```
pip install --upgrade tensorflow
```
